This repository provides a Verilog-A model for simulating the Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic Tunnel Junction (STT-MTJ) in Cadence Virtuoso. The model is designed to capture key electrical and magnetic behaviors of the MTJ, including resistance switching dynamics, critical currents, and thermal effects.

Model Language: Verilog-A (STT-MTJ)
